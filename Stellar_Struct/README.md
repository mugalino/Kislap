# Stellar Structure in C++

This is an illustration for integrating the coupled linear system of
ODEs that describe a star in both the Eulerian (spatial coordinate) and the
Lagrangian (mass coordinate) sense. Here we use the RK4 integrator, but I
will add other features that could be more robust for different applications
relevant to stellar physics.

This will be developed continuously. Notice that there are a couple of 
headers that are relevant in the physics/astrophysics side. 

Integrator: Runge-Kutta // RK-4
